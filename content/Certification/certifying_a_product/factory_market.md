Placeholder - much of the technical side of the factory process is covered in the development section because affects the design of the software and partitioning in really significant ways. Should this just refer back? Or move that down here. The platforms have fairly specific recommendations around partitioning and key storage - For the technical side, it probably make sense to just refer back to the development section and add specific links to the platform documentation in the SDK.

## Packaging
- much like the technical information, this seems perhaps a bit late to start talking about this. Is there a better section?
- add links to the marketing requirements for logos
- add links to the marketing requirements for setup codes
- additional badging? WW programs?
### Works-with programs
- TODO: is that a universal name?

## DCL
- add links to the DCL how-to information
- still missing - timeline of when updates should happen and a simplified text around who has to make the updates

## Submission to the interoperability lab
- can copy a brief writeup of what the interop lab is and add links
