# The Matter Specifications

The Matter Specification is updated twice a year in Spring and Fall.

The specification is made up of a number of documents:

- The Core Specification defines the components and how they interact along with a number of common procedures.
- The Application Cluster Specification details the data models used by each cluster that makes up an endpoint.
- The Device Library Specification sets out the types of End User device in Matter and which Application Clusters make up that device.
- The Namespace Specification (introduced in 1.2) details common data formats and structures used across multiple clusters.

All these documents can be downloaded from [The Alliance website](https://csa-iot.org/developer-resource/specifications-download-request/).

For members, in-progress versions of the specification can be found in the [Secure document access portal](https://docs.csa-iot.org/) (requires CSA member login).
