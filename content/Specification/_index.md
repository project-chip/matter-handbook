# The Matter Specifications


The Matter Specification is updated twice a year in Spring and Fall.
- Version 1.0 was published in November 2022 
- Version 1.1 was published in April 2023
- Version 1.2 was published in October 2023

The specification is made up of a number of documents:

- The Core Specification defines the components and how they interact along with a number of common procedures.
- The Application Cluster Specification details the data models used by each cluster that makes up an endpoint.
- The Device Library Specification sets out the types of End User device in Matter and which Application Clusters make up that device.
- The Namespace Specification (introduced in 1.2) details common data formats and structures used across multiple clusters.
