## Utility Device Types

Utility device types may be include in any device.

### Root Node

All devices must include a Root Node on Endpoint 0. This endpoint is akin to a "read me first" endpoint that describes itself and the other endpoints that make up the node.

### Power Source

This utility device type can be used on one or more endpoints to describe the configuration and capabilities of a physical power source that provides power to one or more endpoints on a node.

### OTA Requestor

An OTA Requestor is a device that is capable of receiving an OTA software update.

### OTA Provider

An OTA Provider is a node that is capable of providing an OTA software update to other nodes on the same fabric.

### Bridged Node

A Bridged Node root endpoint is akin to a "read me first" endpoint that describes itself and any other endpoints that make up the Bridged Node. A Bridged Node endpoint represents a device on a foreign network, but is not the root endpoint of the bridge itself.

### Electrical Sensor

An Electrical Sensor device measures the electrical power and/or energy passing through it. This device type can be added to any matter device so that its electrical power and energy consumption or production can be reported.

### Device Energy Management

A Device Energy Management device provides reporting and optionally adjustment of the electrical power planned on being consumed or produced by the device. 

This allows it to be used to help energy management systems to optimize the energy use across multiple devices in the home (e.g. to match the local solar power being generated, or to provide assistance to the grid). 


## Application Device Types

The device supports adjustment of color by means of hue/saturation, enhanced hue, color looping, XY coordinates, and color temperature. In addition, the extended color light is also capable of being switched by means of a bound occupancy sensor.

### Smart Plugs/Outlets and Other Actuators

#### On/Off Plug-in Unit

An On/Off Plug-in Unit is a device that is capable of being switched on or off by means of a bound controller device such as an On/Off Light Switch or a Dimmer Switch. The On/Off Plug-in Unit is typically used to control a conventional non-communicating light by switching its mains connection. Other appliances can be controlled this way as well.

into it, and is capable of switching that provided power on or off.

#### Mounted Dimmable Load Control

A Mounted Dimmable Load Control is a fixed device that provides power to another device that is
plugged into it, and is capable of being switched on or off and have its level adjusted. The Mounted
Dimmable Load Control is typically used to control a conventional non-communicating light
through its mains connection using phase cutting.

#### Pump

A Pump device is a pump that may have variable speed. It may have optional built-in sensors and a regulation mechanism. It is typically used for pumping fluids like water.

#### Water Valve

A Water Valve can be used to control the flow of water, including automatic closing after a specified duration, with optional features to support opening levels. It may optionally include flow measurement sensors.

### Switches and Controls

#### On/Off Light Switch

An On/Off Light Switch is a controller device that, when bound to a lighting device such as an On/Off Light, is capable of being used to switch the device on or off.

#### Dimmer Switch

A Dimmer Switch is a controller device that, when bound to a lighting device such as a Dimmable Light, is capable of being used to switch the device on or off and adjust the intensity of the light being emitted.

#### Color Dimmer Switch

A Color Dimmer Switch is a controller device that, when bound to a lighting device such as an Extended Color Light, is capable of being used to adjust the color of the light being emitted.

#### Control Bridge

A Control Bridge is a controller device that, when bound to a lighting device such as an Extended Color Light, is capable of being used to switch the device on or off, adjust the intensity of the light being emitted and adjust the color of the light being emitted. In addition, a Control Bridge device is capable of being used for setting scenes.

#### Pump Controller

A Pump Controller device is capable of configuring and controlling a Pump device.

#### Generic Switch

A generic switch can be either momentary or latching in state, with multiple positions.

The Generic Switch device type and the On/Off Light Switch device type both convey information about interactions with a switch to another device.

- The On/Off Light Switch will send On/Off/Toggle commands from its On/Off (client) cluster to a device implementing the On/Off (server) cluster to control the on/off functionality of that device. An On/Off Light Switch device can also implement Groups and Scenes clusters and thus send group and scene commands. Basically, it is targeted at directly sending control commands to other devices. The binding table is used to tell the device where to send the commands.
- The Generic Switch device type will send updates of attributes (for Latching Switch only) and events to subscribed parties which implement the Switch client cluster, as indications of inter­ action with the switch - leaving the interpretation (e.g. which device should be actuated because of the interaction) to the subscribed party. So it can be compared to a sensor-type device.

This allows a more comprehensive controller to combine the information from the switch with other inputs or information sources (e.g. time of day, user presence) to determine which control commands (e.g. on/off, scene recall, attribute change) are sent to other devices in the network.

### Sensors

#### Contact Sensor

The Contact Sensor is a device that reports a boolean state, typically open/closed.

#### Light Sensor

#### On/Off Sensor

An On/Off Sensor is a measurement and sensing device that, when bound to a lighting device such as a Dimmable Light, is capable of being used to switch the device on or off.

#### Smoke CO Alarm

Smoke CO Alarms are capable of monitoring themselves and issuing visual and audible alerts for hardware faults, critical low battery conditions, and end of service. Optionally, some of the audible alerts can be temporarily silenced. Smoke CO Alarms are capable of performing a self-test which performs a diagnostic of the primary sensor and issuing a cycle of the audible and visual life safety alarm indications.
Some smoke alarms MAY be capable of adjusting sensitivity. Smoke CO Alarm MAY have the ability to detect and report humidity levels, temperature levels, and contamination levels.
