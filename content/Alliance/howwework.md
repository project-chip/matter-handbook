### Working Groups
The Alliance has a number of Working Groups responsible for each of the different standards that we manage.

Matter is one such Working Group, the WG is governed by a Steering Committee. The SC manages overall activities, priorities, scope & budget of the Working Group.

Beneath the Matter Working Group are 3 Sub Groups:

### Marketing Product Sub Group

The MPSG are responsible for capturing use cases, identifying functional/non-functional requirements and producing marketing requirements documents (MRD’s) for hand-over to the Technical Sub Group.
They also develop branding, positioning and external communications materials relating to Matter.

### Technical Sub Group
The TSG develops the technical aspects of the Matter from the requirements given to them and takes this through specification release.
The Matter TSG also has an active Software Development Tiger Team who maintain and develop the open source Matter SDK.

### Certification Sub Group
The CSG develops methods to test for specification conformance, from test cases & scripts, to test events leading up to specification release.

### Tiger Teams
Additionally each Sub Group forms a number of Tiger Teams to focus on a specific topic or item and feed this work up into the sub group. Some teams are ongoing, others are formed for the purpose of a specific deliverable and then dissolved.

### Joining
Membership of each working group is open to a member company holding participant or promoter level membership. Once a member company has formally joined a WG then employees of that company can participate in the sub groups and tiger teams.
