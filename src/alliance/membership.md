## Join The Alliance

Work with the world’s most innovative companies to create, evolve, and promote universal open standards that connect all IoT devices – regardless of country, network, brand, or function – for a unifying wireless experience that inspires new possibilities for people everywhere.

### Membership at a Glance

Curious about which level is right for your company? Below is an overview of the four types of membership available:

**Associate Members** use standards-based IoT products but do not directly build or manufacture them. To join at the Associate level and certify white-label products, a company must partner with an Alliance Participant or Promoter member through our Certification Transfer Program.

**Adopter Members** use existing, approved specifications to build products. Adopters can access completed, approved standards documents, certify products through Alliance certification programs, and use Alliance technology logos and trademarks for certified products.

**Participant Members** contribute to and develop standards they will later adopt and use. Participants can access Alliance Working Groups, are hands-on in developing specifications, and gain early access to draft specifications and testing, with the opportunity to develop and get to market faster.

**Promoter Members** contribute to, develop, and adopt Alliance standards and enjoy all other member-level benefits. Promoters help lead the Alliance with final approval on all standards, hold a seat on the Alliance Board of Directors, and may lead and participate in Board Committees.
