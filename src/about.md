# About

This handbook helps you plan, build, and ship Matter devices by answering common questions and connecting
you to the right resources. You’ll find orientation on working with CSA Working Groups, foundational Matter concepts,
and practical guidance for navigating SDKs and tools.

## What This Handbook Is (and Isn’t)

{.list-icon}
- :icon-info: **Informative companion**: Explains concepts, typical approaches, and decision points. No normative requirements live here.
- :icon-telescope: **Wayfinding layer**: Each page points to the appropriate official sources where requirements and formal processes are defined.
- :icon-workflow: **Practical guidance**: Focuses on explanations, patterns, and pointers you can apply in your workflow. Content may include tips or illustrative examples where useful, but it is not prescriptive.

## Access and Openness

We aggregate as much useful information as possible, including pointers to CSA member resources. Some linked
destinations may require CSA membership. If you frequently encounter gated links and want to participate directly,
consider [joining the Connectivity Standards Alliance](alliance/membership#join-the-alliance).

-  Media: For official updates, see the [CSA Newsroom](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/) or contact press@csa-iot.org.

## Source of Truth

Content here is compiled by contributors as an educational guide. When there’s any discrepancy,
the official Matter specification, SDK documentation, and CSA policies take precedence.
Treat this site as an explainer and navigator; consult the spec for requirements.

## Who This Is For

- **Builders**: device makers, platform vendors, bridge and controller developers
- **Operators**: testers, certification coordinators, installers
- **Contributors**: folks engaging with the standards process and Working Groups
- **Media**: looking for high-level orientation and official contacts

## Contributing and Feedback

We welcome fixes and additions. Open an issue or submit a PR in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/project-chip/matter-handbook).
Helpful contributions include clarifying explanations, improved search cues, and additional examples.

Editorial guardrails:
- Keep content informative; do not restate requirements.
- Prefer durable, version‑agnostic terminology; add synonyms to aid discovery.
- Non‑normative style: Avoids “must,” “shall,” and “required.” You’ll see “typically,” “consider,” and “common patterns.”
