## Develop

We create, evolve, and manage IoT technology standards through a well-established, collaborative process. We empower companies with practical, usable assets and tools to ease and accelerate development, freeing them to focus on new areas of IoT innovation.

## Certify

Our strong certification programs help Members avoid unnecessary development cycles, ensure compliance, and validate interoperability. Certification and our stamp of approval tell the world they can buy and use Alliance-certified products and platforms with confidence.

## Promote

We are allies for a connected future. Our membership, spanning the globe and the IoT value chain, actively seeks to promote the benefits of global, open standards, the value of the IoT to customers and consumers, and to break down the barriers to broad access and adoption of IoT technologies and solutions.
