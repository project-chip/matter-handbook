Companies need to be a member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance (Alliance) in order to certify and release
products using Matter.

See [Becoming a Member](https://csa-iot.org/become-member/) to learn more about
joining the Alliance.

A Vendor ID is used to identify the manufacturer of products and is required before
certifying a product. Vendor IDs are assigned by the Alliance and appear in the device
firmware and in the attestation certificates to identify the manufacturer and show the
product has been properly certified. Companies should send requests for new Vendor
IDs to [help@csa-iot.org](mailto:help@csa-iot.org) or through the
[Contact Us page](https://csa-iot.org/contact-us/).
