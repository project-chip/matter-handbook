## Author guidelines
This is an informal set of guidelines for authors, where we can document the conventions that are being used in this Handbook.

### Connectivity Standards Alliance Naming
When referring to the Alliance, in the first reference use the full name as "Connectivity Standards Alliance (Alliance)". Use "Alliance" in subsequent references.

### Public information

This is a public website. Do not include any Alliance confidential information in these documents.

### Acronyms
- Write out acronyms on first use and include the acronym in parentheses
  - First use of a Three Letter Acronym (TLA) should look similar to this.
- Add new acronyms to the `.wordlist.txt` file for the spell checker
- Add new acronyms to the Glossary if appropriate

### External links

The Handbook is meant to be used by a variety of users, not only Alliance members. This may include Adopter and Associate members as well as companies considering membership.

Please use the following guidelines for links:
- When possible, link to public resources (Alliance public website, open source GitHub repositories on `project-chip`)
- If a page contains links to any non-public resource it should include the following disclaimer at the top:
  - `> Some links on this page are only accessible to Alliance members.`
- If a Causeway link is required and the required resource is expected to be used by Adopter members, ensure the resource is a sub-folder in the ["All Members" section](https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/members-all/document). If the resource is expected to be accessible to Adopter members and is not in that folder, consider moving it.
- Pages that contain resources that are specifically aimed at Participant and Promoter members (for example, private GitHub repositories, or access to documents in the Matter work group causeway) should include a disclaimer at the top of the file.
