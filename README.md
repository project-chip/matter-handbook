## Author guidelines
This is an informal set of guidelines for authors, where we can document the conventions that are being used in this handbook.

### Public information

This is a public website. Do not include any Alliance confidential information in these documents.

### Acronyms
- Write out acronyms on first use and include the acronym in parentheses
  - First use of a Three Letter Acronym (TLA) should look similar to this.
- Add new acronyms to the `.wordlist.txt` file for the spell checker
- Add new acronyms glossary if appropriate

### External links

The handbook is meant to be used by a variety of users, not only Alliance members. This may include adopter and associate members as well as companies considering membership.

Please use the following guidelines for links:
- When possible, link to public resources (Alliance public website, open source GitHub repositories on project-chip)
- If a page contains links to any non public resource it should include the following disclaimer at the top:
  - `> Some links on this page are only accessible to Alliance members.`
- If a causeway link is required and the required resource is expected to be used by adopter members, ensure the resource is a sub-folder in the "All Members" section (https://groups.csa-iot.org/wg/members-all/document). If the resource is expected to be accessible to adopter members and is not in that folder, consider moving it.
- Pages that contain resources that are specifically aimed at Participant and Promoter members (ex. private github repositories, access to documents in the Matter work group causeway) should include a disclaimer at the top of the file.
